# Ansible Role: Nexus 3 OSS

This role installs and configures Nexus Repository Manager OSS version 3.x.

All configuration can be updated by re-running the role, except for the [blobstores](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Repository+Management#RepositoryManagement-BlobStores) related settings, which are immutable in nexus.

## History / Credits

This role is a fork of [ansible-nexus3-oss](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/ansible-nexus3-oss) by [@savoirfairelinux](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux) after they announced end of maintenance.
You can have a look at the following tickets in the original repository for explanations:
- https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/ansible-nexus3-oss/issues/36
- https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/ansible-nexus3-oss/issues/38

We would like to thank the original authors for the work done.

## Requirements

- Fairly Up-to-date version of ansible. We follow ansible versions during maintenance/development and will take advantage
of new features if needed (and update meta/main.yml for minimum version)
- Compatible OS. This role is tested through molecule on travis CI for CentOS 8, Ubuntu Bionic (18.04),
 and Debian buster. Other molecule scenarios can be played locally for CentOS 7, Ubuntu Xenial (16.04), and Debian stretch
- Rsync has to be installed on the target machine (it is not needed on the host running ansible if different)
- `jmespath` library needs to be installed on the host running the playbook (needed for the `json_query` filter). See `requirements.txt`
- Java 8 (mandatory)
    - **Oracle announced Java 8 EOL. Sonatype is now recommending openjdk8**
    - For more information see [nexus3 system requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/System+Requirements)
- Apache HTTPD (optional)
    - Used to setup a SSL reverse-proxy
    - The following modules must be enabled in your configuration: mod_ssl, mod_rewrite, mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http, mod_headers.

(see [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below for matching roles on galaxy)

## Role Variables

Ansible variables, along with the default values (see `default/main.yml`) :

### General variables
```yaml
    nexus_version: ''
    nexus_timezone: 'UTC'
    nexus_download_url: "http://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3"
    # nexus_download_ssl_verify: <unset>
    # nexus_version_running: <unset>
```

The role will install latest nexus available version by default. You may fix the version by setting
the `nexus_version` variable. See available versions at https://www.sonatype.com/download-oss-sonatype.

If you fix the version and change it to a different one, the role will try to upgrade your installation.
**Make sure to change to a later version in release history**. Downgrading will fail (unless you re-install
from scratch using the [`nexus_purge` special var](#purge-nexus))

If you don't fix the version and play the role on an existing installation, the current installed version will be used
(detecting target of `{{ nexus_installation_dir}}/nexus-latest`). If you want to upgrade nexus, you will have to pass
the special var `nexus_upgrade=true` on the ansible-playbook command line.
See [Upgrade nexus to latest version](#upgrade-nexus-to-latest-version)

If you use an older version of nexus than the lastest, you should make sure you do not use features which are
not available in the installed release (e.g. yum hosted repositories for nexus < 3.8.0, git lfs repo for nexus < 3.3.0, etc.)

`nexus_timezone` is a Java Timezone name and can be useful in combinationwith `nexus_scheduled_tasks` cron expressions below.

You may change the download site for packages by tuning `nexus_download_url` (e.g. closed environment,
proxy/cache on your network...). **In this case, the automatic detection of the latest version will most likelly fail
and you will have to fix the version to download.** If you still want to take advantage of automatic latest version detection,
a call to `<your_custom_location>/latest-unix.tar.gz` must return an HTTP 302 redirect to the latest available version
in your cache/proxy. If your download location uses https with a self-signed certificate (or a from a private PKI) and
you are having troubles getting it validated (i.e. download errors in the role) and you fully trust the target
you can set `nexus_download_ssl_verify: false`.

`nexus_version_running` is a variable used internally. **As such, it should never be set directly**
It will exist only if nexus is currently installed on the host and will register the current version prior to running
the role. It can be used later in your playbook if needed (e.g. for an upgrade notification email)

### Download dir for nexus package
```yaml
    nexus_download_dir: '/tmp'
```

Directory on target where the nexus package will be downloaded.

**Important note**: if you intend to run the role periodically to maintain/provision your nexus install, you should make
sure the downloaded files will persists between run. On RHEL/Centos specifically, you should change this dir to a location that
is not cleaned up automatically. If the package file does not persit, it will be downloaded again which might cause an unnecessary restart of nexus.

### Nexus port, context path ans listening IP
```yaml
    nexus_default_port: 8081
    nexus_application_host: '{{ httpd_setup_enable | ternary("127.0.0.1", "0.0.0.0") }}'
    nexus_default_context_path: '/'
```

Listening port/ip, and context path of the java nexus process.
* the listening IP/Interface (i.e. `nexus_application_host`) is by default dependant on the `httpd_setup_enable` setting.
Nexus will listen only on localhost (127.0.0.1) if reverse proxy is enabled or all configured IP (0.0.0.0) if not. You
can change this setting to your actual need (i.e. don't install proxy and still bind to 127.0.0.1 only if you install
your own proxy)
* `nexus_default_context_path` has to keep the trailing slash when set, for ex. : `nexus_default_context_path: '/nexus/'`.

### Nexus OS user and group
```yaml
    nexus_os_group: 'nexus'
    nexus_os_user: 'nexus'
```

User and group used to own the nexus files and run the service, those will be created by the role if absent.

```yaml
    nexus_os_user_home_dir: '/home/nexus'
```

Allow to change the nexus user default home directory

### Nexus instance directories
```yaml
    nexus_installation_dir: '/opt'
    nexus_data_dir: '/var/nexus'
    nexus_tmp_dir: "{{ (ansible_os_family == 'RedHat') | ternary('/var/nexus-tmp', '/tmp/nexus') }}"
```

Nexus directories.
* `nexus_installation_dir` contains the installed executable(s)
* `nexus_data_dir` contains all configuration, repositories and uploaded artifacts. Custom blobstores paths outside 
of `nexus_data_dir` can be configured, see `nexus_blobstores` below.
* `nexus_tmp_dir` contains all temporary files. Default path for redhat has been moved out of `/tmp` to overcome
potential problems with automatic cleaning procedures. See #168.

### Nexus JVM Ram setting
```yaml
    nexus_min_heap_size: "1200M"
    nexus_max_heap_size: "{{ nexus_min_heap_size }}"
    nexus_max_direct_memory: "2G"
```
These are the defaults for Nexus. **Please do not modify those values** _unless you have read [the memory section of nexus system requirements](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/system-requirements#SystemRequirements-Memory)_ and you understand what you are doing.

As a second warning, here is an extract from the above document:
> Increasing the JVM heap memory larger than recommended values in an attempt to improve performance is not recommended. This actually can have the opposite effect, causing the operating system to thrash needlessly.

### Plugin installation
```yaml
nexus_plugin_urls: []
```
Put list of urls pointing to plugins build for your Nexus version. Only *.kar bundles can be installed this way.

### Onboarding Wizard
```yaml
nexus_onboarding_wizard: false
```
Controls whether the nexus onboarding wizard runs when the admin user logs in for the first time

### Admin password
```yaml
    nexus_admin_password: 'changeme'
```
The 'admin' account password to setup. _This works only on first time install by default_. Please see [Change admin password after first install](#change-admin-password-after-first-install) if you want to change it later with the role.

**It is strongly advised that you do not keep your password in clear text in you playbook and use [ansible-vault encryption](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html) (either inline or in a separate file loaded with include_vars for example)**


### Default anonymous access
```yaml
    nexus_anonymous_access: false
```

Allow [anonymous access](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Anonymous+Access) to nexus.

### Public hostname
```yaml
    nexus_public_hostname: 'nexus.vm'
    nexus_public_scheme: https
```

The fully qualified domain name and scheme under which the nexus instance will be accessible to its clients.

### API access for this role
```yaml
    nexus_api_hostname: localhost
    nexus_api_scheme: http
    nexus_api_validate_certs: "{{ nexus_api_scheme == 'https' }}"
    nexus_api_context_path: "{{ nexus_default_context_path }}"
    nexus_api_port: "{{ nexus_default_port }}"
```
These vars control how the role connects to the nexus API for provisionning.
**For advance usage only. You most probably do not want to change these default settings**

### Branding capabalities
```yaml
    nexus_branding_header: ""
    nexus_branding_footer: "Last provisionned {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}"
```

Header and footer branding, those can contain HTML.

### Audit capability
```yaml
    nexus_audit_enabled: false
```

The [Auditing capability of nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/security/auditing) is off by default. You can turn it on by switching this to `true`. Please note that the audit data is stored in nexus db, persits accross reboots and is not automatically rotated/cleared.

### Reverse proxy setup
```yaml
    httpd_setup_enable: false
    httpd_server_name: "{{ nexus_public_hostname }}"
    httpd_default_admin_email: "admin@example.com"
    httpd_ssl_certificate_file: 'files/nexus.vm.crt'
    httpd_ssl_certificate_key_file: 'files/nexus.vm.key'
    # httpd_ssl_certificate_chain_file: "{{ httpd_ssl_certificate_file }}"
    httpd_copy_ssl_files: true
```

Setup an [SSL Reverse-proxy](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Run+Behind+a+Reverse+Proxy#RunBehindaReverseProxy-Example:ReverseProxySSLTerminationatBasePath).
This needs httpd installed. Note : when `httpd_setup_enable` is set to `true`, nexus binds by default to 127.0.0.1:8081
thus *not* being directly accessible on HTTP port 8081 from an external IP. (If you want to change this, you can explicitely
set `nexus_application_host: 0.0.0.0`)

The default hostname used is `nexus_public_hostname`. If you need different names for whatever reason, you can set
`httpd_server_name` to a different value.

With `httpd_copy_ssl_files: true` (default), the above certs must exist in your playbook dir and will be copied to the server and configured in apache. `httpd_ssl_certificate_chain_file` is optional and must be left unset if you do not want to configure a chain file.

If you want to use existing certificates on the server, set `httpd_copy_ssl_files: false` and provide the following variables

```yaml
    # These specifies to the vhost where to find on the remote server file
    # system the certificate files.
    httpd_ssl_cert_file_location: "/etc/pki/tls/certs/wildcard.vm.crt"
    httpd_ssl_cert_key_location: "/etc/pki/tls/private/wildcard.vm.key"
    # httpd_ssl_cert_chain_file_location: "{{ httpd_ssl_cert_file_location }}"
```

`httpd_ssl_cert_chain_file_location` is optional and must be left unset if you do not want to configure a chain file

```yaml
    httpd_default_admin_email: "admin@example.com"
```

Set httpd default admin email address

### LDAP configuration

Ldap connections and security realm are disabled by default

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: false
    ldap_connections: []
```

[LDAP connection(s)](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/LDAP) setup, each item goes as follow :

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: true
    ldap_connections:
      - ldap_name: 'My Company LDAP' # used as a key to update the ldap config
        ldap_protocol: 'ldaps' # ldap or ldaps
        ldap_hostname: 'ldap.mycompany.com'
        ldap_port: 636
        ldap_use_trust_store: false # Wether or not to use certs in the nexus trust store
        ldap_search_base: 'dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_auth: 'none' # or simple
        ldap_auth_username: 'username' # if auth = simple
        ldap_auth_password: 'password' # if auth = simple
        ldap_user_base_dn: 'ou=users'
        ldap_user_filter: '(cn=*)' # (optional)
        ldap_user_object_class: 'inetOrgPerson'
        ldap_user_id_attribute: 'uid'
        ldap_user_real_name_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_user_email_attribute: 'mail'
        ldap_user_subtree: false
        ldap_map_groups_as_roles: false
        ldap_group_base_dn: 'ou=groups'
        ldap_group_object_class: 'posixGroup'
        ldap_group_id_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_group_member_attribute: 'memberUid'
        ldap_group_member_format: '${username}'
        ldap_group_subtree: false
```

Example LDAP config for anonymous authentication (anonymous bind), this is also the "minimal" config :

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: true
    ldap_connection:
      - ldap_name: 'Simplest LDAP config'
        ldap_protocol: 'ldaps'
        ldap_hostname: 'annuaire.mycompany.com'
        ldap_search_base: 'dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_port: 636
        ldap_use_trust_store: false
        ldap_user_id_attribute: 'uid'
        ldap_user_real_name_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_user_email_attribute: 'mail'
        ldap_user_object_class: 'inetOrgPerson'
```

Example LDAP config for simple authentication (using a DSA account) :

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: true
    ldap_connections:
      - ldap_name: 'LDAP config with DSA'
        ldap_protocol: 'ldaps'
        ldap_hostname: 'annuaire.mycompany.com'
        ldap_port: 636
        ldap_use_trust_store: false
        ldap_auth: 'simple'
        ldap_auth_username: 'cn=mynexus,ou=dsa,dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_auth_password: "{{ vault_ldap_dsa_password }}" # better keep passwords in an ansible vault
        ldap_search_base: 'dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_user_base_dn: 'ou=users'
        ldap_user_object_class: 'inetOrgPerson'
        ldap_user_id_attribute: 'uid'
        ldap_user_real_name_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_user_email_attribute: 'mail'
        ldap_user_subtree: false
```

Example LDAP config for simple authentication (using a DSA account) + groups mapped as roles :

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: true
    ldap_connections
      - ldap_name: 'LDAP config with DSA'
        ldap_protocol: 'ldaps'
        ldap_hostname: 'annuaire.mycompany.com'
        ldap_port: 636
        ldap_use_trust_store: false
        ldap_auth: 'simple'
        ldap_auth_username: 'cn=mynexus,ou=dsa,dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_auth_password: "{{ vault_ldap_dsa_password }}" # better keep passwords in an ansible vault
        ldap_search_base: 'dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_user_base_dn: 'ou=users'
        ldap_user_object_class: 'inetOrgPerson'
        ldap_user_id_attribute: 'uid'
        ldap_user_real_name_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_user_email_attribute: 'mail'
        ldap_map_groups_as_roles: true
        ldap_group_base_dn: 'ou=groups'
        ldap_group_object_class: 'groupOfNames'
        ldap_group_id_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_group_member_attribute: 'member'
        ldap_group_member_format: 'uid=${username},ou=users,dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_group_subtree: false
```

Example LDAP config for simple authentication (using a DSA account) + groups mapped as roles dynamically :

```yaml
    nexus_ldap_realm: true
    ldap_connections:
      - ldap_name: 'LDAP config with DSA'
        ldap_protocol: 'ldaps'
        ldap_hostname: 'annuaire.mycompany.com'
        ldap_port: 636
        ldap_use_trust_store: false
        ldap_auth: 'simple'
        ldap_auth_username: 'cn=mynexus,ou=dsa,dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_auth_password: "{{ vault_ldap_dsa_password }}" # better keep passwords in an ansible vault
        ldap_search_base: 'dc=mycompany,dc=net'
        ldap_user_base_dn: 'ou=users'
        ldap_user_object_class: 'inetOrgPerson'
        ldap_user_id_attribute: 'uid'
        ldap_user_real_name_attribute: 'cn'
        ldap_user_email_attribute: 'mail'
        ldap_map_groups_as_roles: true
        ldap_map_groups_as_roles_type: 'dynamic'
        ldap_user_memberof_attribute: 'memberOf'
```

### Privileges
```yaml
    nexus_privileges:
      - name: all-repos-read # used as key to update a privilege
        # type: <one of application, repository-admin, repository-content-selector, repository-view, script or wildcard>
        description: 'Read & Browse access to all repos'
        repository: '*'
        actions: # can be add, browse, create, delete, edit, read or  * (all)

          - browse
        # pattern: pattern
        # domain: domain
        # script_name: name
```

List of the [privileges](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Privileges) to setup. Please see
documentation and GUI to check out which variables should be set depending on the type of privilege.

Those items are combined with the following default values :

```yaml
    _nexus_privilege_defaults:
      type: repository-view
      format: maven2
      actions:
        - read
```

### Roles
```yaml
    nexus_roles:
      - id: Developpers # can map to a LDAP group id, also used as a key to update a role
        name: developers
        description: All developers
        privileges:
          - nx-search-read
          - all-repos-read
        roles: [] # references to other role names
```

List of the [roles](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Roles) to setup.

### Users
```yaml
    nexus_local_users: []
      # - username: jenkins # used as key to update
      #   state: present # default value if ommited, use 'absent' to remove user
      #   first_name: Jenkins
      #   last_name: CI
      #   email: support@company.com
      #   password: "s3cr3t"
      #   roles:
      #     - developers # role ID
```
Local (non-LDAP) users/accounts list to create in nexus. State `absent` will remove the user if it exists

```yaml
      nexus_ldap_users: []
      # - username: j.doe
      #   state: present
      #   roles:
      #     - "nx-admin"
```
Ldap users/roles mappings. State `absent` will remove roles from the existing user if already present.
Ldap users are not removed. Trying to set roles on a non existing user will result in an error.


### Content selectors
```yaml
  nexus_content_selectors:
  - name: docker-login
    description: Selector for docker login privilege
    search_expression: format=="docker" and path=~"/v2/"
```

For more info on Content selector see [documentation](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/configuration/repository-management#RepositoryManagement-ContentSelectors)

To use content selector add new privilege with `type: repository-content-selector` and proper `contentSelector`
```yaml
- name: docker-login-privilege
  type: repository-content-selector
  contentSelector: docker-login
  description: 'Login to Docker registry'
  repository: '*'
  actions:
  - read
  - browse
```

```

Cleanup policies definitions. Can be added to repo definitions with the option `cleanup_policies`

### Blobstores and repositories
```yaml
    nexus_delete_default_repos: false
```

Delete the repositories from the nexus install initial default configuration. This step is only executed on first-time install (when `nexus_data_dir` has been detected empty).

```yaml
    nexus_delete_default_blobstore: false
```

Delete the default blobstore from the nexus install initial default configuration. This can be done only if `nexus_delete_default_repos: true` and all configured repositories (see below) have an explicit `blob_store: custom`. This step is only executed on first-time install (when `nexus_data_dir` has been detected empty).

```yaml
    nexus_blobstores: []
    # example blobstore item :
    # - name: separate-storage
    #   type: file
    #   path: /mnt/custom/path
    # - name: s3-blobstore
    #   type: S3
    #   config:
    #     bucket: s3-blobstore
    #     accessKeyId: "{{ VAULT_ENCRYPTED_KEY_ID }}"
    #     secretAccessKey: "{{ VAULT_ENCRYPTED_ACCESS_KEY }}"
```

[Blobstores](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Repository+Management#RepositoryManagement-BlobStores) to create. A blobstore path and a repository blobstore cannot be updated after initial creation (any update here will be ignored on re-provisionning).

Configuring blobstore on S3 is provided as a convenience and is not part of the automated tests we run on travis. Please note that storing on S3 is only recommended for instances deployed on AWS.

```yaml
    nexus_repos_maven_proxy:

    #   # negative_cache_ttl: 1440
```

Maven [proxy repositories](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Repository+Management#RepositoryManagement-ProxyRepository) configuration.

```yaml
    nexus_repos_maven_hosted:
      - name: private-release
        version_policy: release
        write_policy: allow_once  # one of "allow", "allow_once" or "deny"
        # cleanup_policies:
        #    - mvn_cleanup
```

Maven [hosted repositories](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Repository+Management#RepositoryManagement-HostedRepository) configuration. Negative cache config is optionnal and will default to the above values if omitted.

```yaml
    nexus_repos_maven_group:
      - name: public
        member_repos:
          - central
          - jboss
```

Maven [group repositories](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Repository+Management#RepositoryManagement-RepositoryGroup) configuration.

All three repository types are combined with the following default values :

```yaml
    _nexus_repos_maven_defaults:
      blob_store: default # Note : cannot be updated once the repo has been created
      strict_content_validation: true
      version_policy: release # release, snapshot or mixed
      layout_policy: strict # strict or permissive
      write_policy: allow_once # one of "allow", "allow_once" or "deny"
      maximum_component_age: -1  # Nexus gui default. For proxies only
      maximum_metadata_age: 1440  # Nexus gui default. For proxies only
      negative_cache_enabled: true # Nexus gui default. For proxies only
      negative_cache_ttl: 1440 # Nexus gui default. For proxies only
```

Docker, Pypi, Raw, Rubygems, Bower, NPM, Git-LFS and yum repository types:
see `defaults/main.yml` for these options:

```yaml
      nexus_config_pypi: false
      nexus_config_docker: false
      nexus_config_raw: false
      nexus_config_rubygems: false
      nexus_config_bower: false
      nexus_config_npm: false
      nexus_config_gitlfs: false
      nexus_config_yum: false
```

These are all false unless you override them from playbook / group_var / cli, these all utilize the same mechanism as maven.

Note that you might need to enable certain security realms if you want to use other repository types than maven. These are
false by default

```yaml
nexus_nuget_api_key_realm: false
nexus_npm_bearer_token_realm: false
nexus_docker_bearer_token_realm: false  # required for docker anonymous access
```

The Remote User Realm can also be enabled with

```yaml
nexus_rut_auth_realm: true
```

and the header can be configured by defining

```yaml
nexus_rut_auth_header: "CUSTOM_HEADER"
```

### Scheduled tasks

These are quick examples and instruction to setup scheduled tasks. For in depth information on available tasks types
and schedule types, please refer to [the specific section in the repo wiki](https://github.com/ansible-ThoTeam/nexus3-oss/wiki/Scheduled-tasks-configuration)

```yaml
    nexus_scheduled_tasks: []
    #  #  Example task to compact blobstore :
    #  - name: compact-docker-blobstore
    #    cron: '0 0 22 * * ?'
    #    typeId: blobstore.compact
    #    task_alert_email: alerts@example.org  # optional
    #    taskProperties:
    #      blobstoreName: {{ nexus_blob_names.docker.blob }} # all task attributes are stored as strings by nexus internally
    #  #  Example task to purge maven snapshots
    #  - name: Purge-maven-snapshots
    #    cron: '0 50 23 * * ?'
    #    typeId: repository.maven.remove-snapshots
    #    task_alert_email: alerts@example.org  # optional
    #    taskProperties:
    #      repositoryName: "*"  # * for all repos. Change to a repository name if you only want a specific one
    #      minimumRetained: "2"
    #      snapshotRetentionDays: "2"
    #      gracePeriodInDays: "2"
    #    booleanTaskProperties:
    #      removeIfReleased: true
    #  #  Example task to purge unused docker manifest and images
    #  - name: Purge unused docker manifests and images
    #    cron: '0 55 23 * * ?'
    #    typeId: "repository.docker.gc"
    #    task_alert_email: alerts@example.org  # optional
    #    taskProperties:
    #      repositoryName: "*"  # * for all repos. Change to a repository name if you only want a specific one
    #  #  Example task to purge incomplete docker uploads
    #  - name: Purge incomplete docker uploads
    #    cron: '0 0 0 * * ?'
    #    typeId: "repository.docker.upload-purge"
    #    task_alert_email: alerts@example.org  # optional
    #    taskProperties:
    #      age: "24"
```

[Scheduled tasks](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/System+Configuration#SystemConfiguration-ConfiguringandExecutingTasks) to setup. `typeId` and task-specific `taskProperties`/`booleanTaskProperties` can be guessed either:
* from the java type hierarchy of `org.sonatype.nexus.scheduling.TaskDescriptorSupport`
* by inspecting the task creation html form in your browser
* from peeking at the browser AJAX requests while manually configuring a task.

**Task properties must be declared in the correct yaml block depending on their type**:
* `taskProperties` for all string properties (i.e. repository names, blobstore names, time periods...).
* `booleanTaskProperties` for all boolean properties (i.e. mainly checkboxes in nexus create task GUI).


### Backups
```yaml
      nexus_backup_configure: false
      nexus_backup_schedule_type: cron
      nexus_backup_cron: '0 0 21 * * ?'  # See cron expressions definition in nexus create task gui
      # nexus_backup_start_date_time: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss"
      # nexus_backup_weekly_days: ['MON', 'TUE', 'WED', 'THU', 'FRI', 'SAT']
      # nexus_backup_monthly_days: {{ range(1,32) | list + [999] }}
      nexus_backup_dir: '/var/nexus-backup'
      nexus_backup_dir_create: true
      nexus_restore_log: '{{ nexus_backup_dir }}/nexus-restore.log'
      nexus_backup_rotate: false
      nexus_backup_rotate_first: false
      nexus_backup_keep_rotations: 4  # Keep 4 backup rotation by default (current + last 3)
```

Backup will not be configured unless you switch `nexus_backup_configure: true`.
In this case, a script task will be configured in nexus.

The script task schedule will be set as `cron` by default and runs every day at 21:00. You can define whatever
schedule you like by setting accordingly the variables `nexus_backup_schedule_type`, `nexus_backup_cron`,
`nexus_backup_start_date_time`, `nexus_backup_weekly_days` and `nexus_backup_monthly_days`. To understand
their usage depending on the type of schedule you choose, please see [Scheduled tasks](#scheduled-tasks)

See [the groovy template for this task](templates/backup.groovy.j2) for details.
This scheduled task is independent from the other `nexus_scheduled_tasks` you
declare in your playbook

If you want to rotate backups, set `nexus_backup_rotate: true` and adjust
the number of rotations you would like to keep with `nexus_backup_keep_rotations`
(defaults to 4).

When using rotation, if you want to save extra disk space during the backup process,
you can set `nexus_backup_rotate_first: true`. This will configure a pre-rotation
rather than the default post-rotation. Please note than in this case, old backup(s)
is/are removed before the current one is done and successful.

If you want to backup to a mounted directory (like s3fs), you can set the `nexus_backup_dir_create` to false.

#### Restore procedure
Run your playbook with parameter `-e nexus_restore_point=<YYYY-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss>`
(e.g. 2017-12-17-21-00-00 for 17th of December 2017 at 21h00m00s)

#### Possible limitations
Blobstore copies are made directly from nexus by the script scheduled task.
This has only been tested on rather small blobstores (less than 50Go) and should
be used with caution and tested carefully on larger installations before moving
to production. In any case, you are free to implement your own backup scenario
outside of this role.

### Special maintenance/debug variables

These are not present in `defaults/main.yml` and are meant to be used on the command line only for maintenance/debug reasons.

#### Purge nexus

** Warning: this will completely erase the current data. Make sure to backup previously if needed **

Use the `nexus_purge` variable if you need to restart from scratch and re-install a blank instance of nexus.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_nexus_playbook.yml -e nexus_purge=true
```

#### Force groovy scripts registration

_This one is safe and will only make the playbook run longer if it wasn't needed_

For performance sake, we use a little trick with several rsync to detect which maintenance groovy scripts need to be registered in Nexus. On some occasions (e.g. bad admin password, recovering a backup from a previous nexus instance with unregistered scripts...), this can lead to situation where the role will fail when attempting to run the needed groovy scripts.

The symptom: you get HTTP 404 errors when the role tries to run scripts like in the following example (use `-v` option for ansible playbook):

```bash
fatal: [nexus3-oss]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "connection": "close", "content": "", "date": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:57:44 GMT", "msg": "Status code was 404 and not [200, 204]: HTTP Error 404: Not Found", "redirected": false, "server": "Nexus/3.13.0-01 (OSS)", "status": 404, "url": "http://localhost:8081/service/rest/v1/script/update_admin_password/run", "x_content_type_options": "nosniff", "x_siesta_faultid": "914acef2-f644-4bd6-9a7d-ce19255ea3dd"}
```

In such cases, you can force the (re-)registration of the groovy scripts with the `nexus_force_groovy_scripts_registration` variable:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml -e nexus_force_groovy_scripts_registration=true
```

#### Change admin password after first install

```yaml
    nexus_default_admin_password: 'admin123'
```
**This should not be changed in your playbook**. This var is filled with the default nexus admin password on first install and ensures we can change the admin password to `nexus_admin_password`.

If you want to change your admin password after first install, you can temporarily change this to your old password from the command line. After changing `nexus_admin_password` in your playbook, you can run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml -e nexus_default_admin_password=oldPassword
```

#### Upgrade nexus to latest version

```yaml
    nexus_upgrade: true
```
**This variable has no effect if `nexus_version` is fixed in your vars**

Unless you set this variable, the role will keep the current installed nexus version when running against
an already provisioned host. Passing this extra var will trigger automatic latest nexus version detection and upgrade
if a newer version is available.

**Setting this var as part of your playbook breaks idempotence** (i.e. your playbook will make changes to your system
if a new version is available although no parameters have changed)

We strongly suggest to use this variable only as an extra var to ansible-playbook call
```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml -e nexus_upgrade=true
```

##### Fix upgrade failing on timeout waiting for nexus port
If you have a large nexus repository, you may occasionally see an error message when upgrading
```
RUNNING HANDLER [nexus3-oss : wait-for-nexus-port] *************
fatal: [nexushost]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "elapsed": 300, "msg": "Timeout when waiting for 127.0.0.1:8081"}
```
This is most likely because the nexus upgrade process (i.e. migrating internal orientdb) is taking longer than
the default 300 seconds. You can overcome this situation by setting a custom timeout in seconds to or/and a number of retries
for the handler task.
```
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml \
-e nexus_upgrade=true \
-e nexus_wait_for_port_timeout=600
-e nexus_wait_for_port_retries=2
```

#### Skip provisionning tasks
```yaml
    nexus_run_provisionning: false
```
This var is unset by default and will default to `true`. Setting it to `false` will cause the role to skip all of the
provisionning tasks and will therefore *not create/update*:
* ldap configurations
* content selectors
* privileges
* roles
* users (except checking/updating admin password)
* blobstores
* repositories
* tasks (backup will still be configured if enabled)

This can save time if you have lots of configured repositories/users/roles... and you want to play the role
to simply check nexus is correctly installed, or restore a backup, or upgrade nexus version.

We strongly suggest to use this variable only as an extra var to ansible-playbook call
```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml -e nexus_run_provisionning=false
```

#### Force recursive ownership check of blobstores directories
_Introduced in version 2.4.9_
```yaml
    nexus_blobstores_recurse_owner: true
```
In versions prior to 2.4.9, the task creating the blobstores directories was recursively checking the ownership
of all files. This was not a problem on creation (where dir is empty) or with installations with small
blobstores, but could lead to extremely long delays for large blobstores with lots of files.

Recursive checking of ownership has been turned off by default to prevent this extra delay. If for some
reason you need to make sure all files in the blobstore directories are owned by the nexus user, you can
force the check:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i your/inventory.ini your_playbook.yml -e nexus_blobstores_recurse_owner=true
```

## Dependencies

The java and httpd requirements /can/ be fulfilled with the following galaxy roles :
  - [geerlingguy.java](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/java/)
  - [geerlingguy.apache](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/apache/)

Feel free to use them or implement your own install scenario at your convenience.

## Development, Contribution and Testing

### Contributions

All contributions to this role are welcome, either for bugfixes, new features or documentation.

If you wish to contribute:
- Fork the repo under your own name/organisation through github interface
- Create a branch in your own repo with a meaningfull name. We suggest the following naming convention:
  - `feat/<someFeature>` for features
  - `fix/<someBugFix>` for bug fixes
  - `docfix/<someDocFix>` for documentation only fixes
- If starting an important feature change, open a pull request early describing what you want to do so we can discuss it if needed. This will prevent you from doing a lot of hard work on a lot of code for changes that we cannot finally merge.
- If there are build error on your pull request, have a look at the travis log and fix the relevant errors.

Moreover, if you have time to devote for code review, merge for realeases, etc... drop an email to contact@thoteam.com to get in touch.


### Testing

This role includes tests and CI integration through travis. At time being, we test:
* groovy scripts syntax
* yaml syntax and coding standard (yamllint)
* ansible good practices (ansible lint)
* a set of basic deployments on 3 different linux platforms
    * Centos 8
    * Debian buster
    * Ubuntu bionic (18.04)

Other tests are available for older platforms but not played on CI for performance reasons:
* Centos 7
* Debian stretch
* Ubuntu xenial (16.04)


#### Groovy syntax

This role contains a set of groovy files used to provision nexus.

If you submit changes to groovy files, please run the groovy syntax check locally before pushing your changes
```bash
./tests/test_groovySyntax.sh
```
This will ensure you push groovy files with correct syntax limiting the number of check errors on travis.

You will need the groovy package installed locally to run this test.

#### Molecule default-xxxx scenarii

The role is tested on travis with [molecule](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/molecule). You can run these tests locally. The best way to achieve this is through a python virtualenv. You can find some more details in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
```bash
# Note: the following path should be outside the working dir
virtualenv /path/to/some/pyenv
. /path/to/some/pyenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
molecule [create|converge|destroy|test] -s <scenario name>
deactivate
```
Please have a look at molecule documentation (a good start is `molecule --help`) for further usage.

The current proposed scenarii refer to the tested platforms (see `molecule/` directory). If you launch a scenario ans leave the container running (i.e. using `converge` for a simple deploy), you can access the running instance from your browser at https://localhost:<linkedPort>. See the `molecule/<scenario>/molecule.yml` file for detail. As a convenience, here is the correspondence between scenarii and configured ports:
* default-centos7 => https://localhost:8090
* default-centos8 => https://localhost:8095
* default-debian_buster => https://localhost:8091
* default-debian_stretch => https://localhost:8092
* default-ubuntu_16.04 => https://localhost:8093
* default-ubuntu_18.04 => https://localhost:8094

To speed up tests, molecule uses docker hub images with automated build.
* Git repo: https://github.com/docker-ThoTeam/molecule_apache_openjdk8
* Docker hub registry: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/thoteam/molecule_apache_openjdk8


#### Molecule selinux scenario

*** Warning: This scenario as been removed for the moment for molecule 3.0 compatibility reason. We it until
we can decide if it can be re-introduced or not ***

We included a second molecule `selinux` scenario. This one is not run on travis but can be used locally to:
* test selinux integration (on centos).
* run test and access the running vms under VirtualBox on you local machine.

If you wish to use this scenario you will need
* VirtualBox
* Vagrant
* molecule

A typical workflow runs like this:
* `molecule create -s selinux`. Once this is complete, you will see two vagrant vms (centos7 and debian-stretch) in your VirtualBox console.
These Vagrant box are taken from http://vagrant.thoteam.com
* `molecule converge -s selinux` will run the [scenario test playbook](molecule/selinux/playbook.yml) against the two vms.
You can pass additionnal variables to ansible on the command line to override playbook or default vars
(e.g. `molecule converge -s selinux -- -e nexus_backup_rotate=true`). You can converge as many times as you want.
* You can now access the gui with https://localhost:9101 (centos7) or https://localhost:9102 (debian-stretch).
You will need to add a security exception for the self signed ssl certificate. If you did not change it with a
command line var above, the default role admin password is "changeme"
* When you're happy with your testing, you can recycle the used space with `molecule destroy -s selinux`
